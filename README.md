This is a basic Node.js and Express backend project with a clean and easy-to-understand structure. It includes separate folders for routes, models, and middleware to keep the code organized. The main entry point of the application is index.js, which starts the server and connects everything together.

How to run the project

First, clone the repository and move into the backend folder. Then install all required dependencies using npm install. Once the installation is complete, start the server using node index.js (or npm run dev if nodemon is configured). After this, the backend server will be up and running, and you can test the APIs using tools like Postman or a frontend application.
